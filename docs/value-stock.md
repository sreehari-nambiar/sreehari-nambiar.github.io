# Valuing Stock

## Dividend Model

In the dividend model, we calculate the value of a stock based on its expected dividends and cost of equity capital.

### Single-Period Model

The price of the stock today, $p_0$, can be determined as follows:

$$p_0 = \frac{Div_1 + p_1}{1 + rE}$$

Where:
- $p_0$: Current Price of the stock
- $p_1$: Stock price at the end of year 1
- $rE$: Equity cost of capital
- $Div_1$: Dividends paid at the end of year 1

The total return can be calculated as:

$$rE = \frac{Div_1 + p_1}{p_0} - 1$$

Or, in another form:

$$rE = \frac{Div_1}{p_0} + \frac{p_1 - p_0}{p_0}$$

This equation shows that the total return is a combination of the Dividend Yield and the Capital Gain Rate. In essence, it represents the expected return of the stock concerning other investments with similar risk in the market.

### Multiyear Investor

For multiyear investors, we calculate the price of the stock as follows:

$$p_0 = \frac{Div_1}{(1+rE)} + \frac{Div_2 + p_2}{(1 + rE)^2}$$

### Dividend-Discount Model

The price of the stock can also be calculated using the Dividend-Discount Model:

$$p_0 = \frac{Div_1}{(1 + rE)} + \frac{Div_2}{(1 + rE)^2} + \ldots + \frac{Div_N}{(1 + rE)^N} + \frac{p_N}{(1 + rE)^N}$$

This equation reflects that the price of the stock is the present value of the expected future dividends it will pay.

### Constant Dividend Growth Model

For the Constant Dividend Growth Model, the formula to calculate the stock price is:

$$p_0 = \frac{Div_1}{(rE - g)}$$

This model depends on the dividend level for the coming year, divided by the equity cost of capital adjusted by the expected growth rate of dividends.

- The share price increases with Div_1 and the expected growth rate, g.
- Firms often face a tradeoff between increasing growth and paying dividends.

The growth rate of the share price with constant expected dividend growth is:

$$rE = \frac{Div_1}{p_0} + g$$

With constant expected dividend growth, the expected growth rate of the share price matches the growth rate of dividends.

### A Firm's Dividend per Share at Date t

The dividend per share at date t can be calculated as:

$$Div_t = \frac{Earnings_t}{Shares Outstanding_t} \times Dividend Payout Rate_t$$

The firm can increase its dividend in three ways:
1. Increase its earnings (net income).
2. Increase its dividend payout rate.
3. Decrease its shares outstanding.

### No Investment

The change in earnings can be calculated as follows:

$$Change in Earnings = New Investments \times Return on New Investments$$

New Investments can be calculated as:

$$New Investments = Earnings \times Retention Rate$$

The earnings growth rate can be determined as:

$$Earnings Growth Rate = \frac{Change in Earnings}{Earnings} = Retention Rate \times Return in New Investments$$

If the firm chooses to keep its dividend payout rate constant, then the growth in dividends will equal the growth of earnings:

$$g = Retention Rate \times Return on New Investment$$

Note: g is sometimes called the sustainable growth rate.

**Cutting the firmâ€™s dividend to increase investment will raise the stock price if, and only if, the new investments have a positive NPV.**
